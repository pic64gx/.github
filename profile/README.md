# PIC64GX® SoC Embedded Software

The PIC64GX MPU family meets mid-range intelligent edge compute needs with a 64-bit RISC-V® quad-core processor offering asymmetric multiprocessing and deterministic latencies. It features a configurable processor and memory subsystem to support secure boot and key management for military-grade security. The five-stage in-order pipeline is not vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre exploits. Featuring a rich set of embedded peripherals and fully pin compatible with PolarFire® SoC FPGAs, the PIC64GX is an excellent choice for developing power-efficient embedded-compute platforms.
