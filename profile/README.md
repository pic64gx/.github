# PIC64GX速 64-bit RISC-V速 Quad-Core Microprocessor Embedded Software

The PIC64GX MPU family meets mid-range intelligent edge compute needs with a 64-bit RISC-V速 quad-core processor offering asymmetric multiprocessing and deterministic latencies. It features a configurable processor and memory subsystem to support secure boot and key management for military-grade security. The five-stage in-order pipeline is not vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre exploits. Featuring a rich set of embedded peripherals and fully pin compatible with PolarFire速 SoC FPGAs, the PIC64GX is an excellent choice for developing power-efficient embedded-compute platforms.
